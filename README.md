Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software that is designed for machine learning. It has integrated with modules like Catboost, Keras, LightGBM, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost and many more. The details about Optuna can be found <a href='https://optuna.org/'> here </a>.

We are using kidney stone data - that is classification analysis performed over data to predict whether a patient has a kidney stone or not.
